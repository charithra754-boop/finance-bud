4. Use unit tests + validation for every agent before merge
5. Use GitHub Issues to track bugs and assign cross-check tasks
6. Regular sync meetings to ensure interface compatibility
7. Shared data models and API contracts defined upfront
8. Integration testing begins once all systems reach MVP status

### Documentation Standards
- All APIs documented with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Agent interfaces documented with clear data contracts
- Database schema documented with relationships
- Deployment procedures documented step-by-step
