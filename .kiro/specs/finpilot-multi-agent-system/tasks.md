## Integration Safety Tips & Development Guidelines

### Parallel Development Strategy

1. Use Pydantic schemas as strict data contracts - no deviation allowed
2. Mock others' outputs early — don't wait for full integration
3. Each agent logs input → process → output in JSON format
4. Use unit tests + validation for every agent before merge
5. Use GitHub Issues to track bugs and assign cross-check tasks
6. Regular sync meetings to ensure interface compatibility
7. Shared data models and API contracts defined upfront
8. Integration testing begins once all systems reach MVP status

- Integration tests required for all external interfaces
- Performance benchmarks established for critical paths
- Security testing for all API endpoints and data handling
- Mock integration testing before real system integration

### Documentation Standards

- All APIs documented with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Agent interfaces documented with clear data contracts
- Database schema documented with relationships
- Deployment procedures documented step-by-step
- Docstrings must include Pydantic model definitions for tool identification
- JSON schema documentation for all inter-agent messages

### Quality Gates

- Code review required for all changes
